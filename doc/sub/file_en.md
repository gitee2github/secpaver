## File Permission Keywords

File permissions vary with security mechanisms. To shield differences for users, secPaver extracts and encapsulates some common file permissions.

| Permission  |              Description              |             Note              |

|   mounton   |          Use as mount point.          | Only valid for SELinux policy |

### Note

- The file permissions of the SELinux mechanism are complex and cannot be completely overwritten. If you need to use the file permissions, you can directly enter the permissions in the actions column. The secPaver checks the extended permissions. If the permissions are valid, they are added to SELinux rules.
- For ease of use, the main application has the search permission on directory files (except files set to private) by default during policy generation.
